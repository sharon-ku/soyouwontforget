### Jotting down ideas, theme of death

Fear of death

Resuscitate a dying plant by rewinding time

"I had a dream the other day."<br>
"Yeah? What was it about?"<br>
"It was about this box."<br>
...<br>
(visiting the dead through a dream? dream contains a physical box that stores keepsakes of the dead)

When death becomes too much of a burden to handle, you have the option to forget about a person.<br>
A game where we have the choice to forget about a loved one who passed away

Trying desperately to preserve death<br>
A game for people who are unable to accept death --> choice of adding time to a life or freeze a moment

I hate goodbyes. I hate saying goodbye to someone I love and never seeing them again. It's a suffocating feeling.

A snow globe that carries your memories of a loved one who passed away. Shattering into pieces. Memories lost forever.

That was the initial idea I had in mind. I imagined a world where memories are selective. There is only so much memory one can store and tolerate. Some memories make us stronger, some we need to let go of.

Grief is _not_ a memory worth storing. To help people get over their grief, this world allows each person to preserve their memories of the dead for 5 years in a snow globe-looking device. That's the amount of time needed to get over the grief. Afterwards, the memories are gone for good.

"Sorry, your storage has expired. The device and all its constituent memories will self-destruct in 5 minutes."

So maybe I can present a scene where you witness a cherished memory being erased?

Ultimately, I want my game to show how grief is not necessarily worth destroying. And show how memories of the dead don't need to be thought of as sad.

### Project goals

I still haven't worked out how I want the game to play out. But I have some goals in mind:

- I want my game to involve storytelling in some way.
- I want my game to be sad.
- I want my game to evoke the feeling of loss, not so much with the departed person, but rather with the lost memories.

### Literal Brain Storms, Brain Hurdles I Need to Overcome

I can't pinpoint what kind of game I want to create:

- a storytelling game made with p5, or a Bitsy game?
- should my game be driven by text or visuals?

### Phone instead of snow globe

I spoke to a friend about my idea. He said maybe instead of using a snow globe, the device can be a phone. And the person can choose to erase the memories whenever they want to. He also showed me a two-minute clip of Men in Black, where the spy people flashed a flashlight thingamabob into other people's eyes and reset their memories (please excuse me if I'm getting the plot wrong, I never watched the movie).

I liked the idea of swapping the snow globe with a phone. The device's functions appear more concrete. I can create an interface with play and trim functions, as well as the ability to rewind the memory like a video. But this also poses other problems, like how do I present these memories (with limited time, I won't be able to draw out numerous scenes)? Or how do I tell a story with the interface and convey feelings of loss?

I need to rework this idea.
