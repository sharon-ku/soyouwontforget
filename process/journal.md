# Process Journal

This journal teleports you into the behind-the-scenes of my game-making process (welcome!üëã).

I like documenting my thoughts using a mix of writing ‚úèÔ∏è and sketches üñçÔ∏è.

I have approximately two months to create a game that combines speculative play and the theme of death.

## Schedule

To orient myself, I created this rough schedule of things to do per week:<br>
(and yes, I start counting my weeks as of Saturdays)

JULY:

1. ‚úîÔ∏è **July 7-9:** presentation of theme, brainstorm ideas
2. ‚úîÔ∏è **July 10-16:** brainstorm ideas
3. ‚úîÔ∏è **July 17-23:** research and solidify game concept, start prototyping idea --> up to now, finished 13h
4. ‚úîÔ∏è **July 24-30:** code, create assets --> 8h

AUGUST:

1. ‚úîÔ∏è **July 31 - Aug 6:** code --> 8h
2. ‚úîÔ∏è **Aug 7-13:** code, conduct midway playtest with team --> 10h
3. ‚úîÔ∏è **Aug 14-20:** code --> 8h
4. ‚úîÔ∏è **Aug 21-27:** code, refine, conduct final playtests --> 6h
5. ‚úîÔ∏è **Aug 28-31:** refine, write final thoughts in journal --> 2h

PLUS 5 hours to place where needed

[Doing more work now for the fun of it.]

### Jotting down ideas, theme of death

Fear of death

Resuscitate a dying plant by rewinding time

"I had a dream the other day."<br>
"Yeah? What was it about?"<br>
"It was about this box."<br>
...<br>
(visiting the dead through a dream? dream contains a physical box that stores keepsakes of the dead)

When death becomes too much of a burden to handle, you have the option to forget about a person.<br>
A game where we have the choice to forget about a loved one who passed away

Trying desperately to preserve death<br>
A game for people who are unable to accept death --> choice of adding time to a life or freeze a moment

## Monday, July 12, 2021, sometime at night

I hate goodbyes. I hate saying goodbye to someone I love and never seeing them again. It's a suffocating feeling.

---

A snow globe that carries your memories of a loved one who passed away. Shattering into pieces. Memories lost forever.

That was the initial idea I had in mind. I imagined a world where memories are selective. There is only so much memory one can store and tolerate. Some memories make us stronger, some we need to let go of.

Grief is _not_ a memory worth storing. To help people get over their grief, this world allows each person to preserve their memories of the dead for 5 years in a snow globe-looking device. That's the amount of time needed to get over the grief. Afterwards, the memories are gone for good.

"Sorry, your storage has expired. The device and all its constituent memories will self-destruct in 5 minutes."

So maybe I can present a scene where you witness a cherished memory being erased?

Ultimately, I want my game to show how grief is not necessarily worth destroying. And show how memories of the dead don't need to be thought of as sad.

---

### Project goals

I still haven't worked out how I want the game to play out. But I have some goals in mind:

- I want my game to involve storytelling in some way.
- I want my game to be sad.
- I want my game to evoke the feeling of loss, not so much with the departed person, but rather with the lost memories.

---

### Brain storms/hurdles I need to overcome

I can't pinpoint what kind of game I want to create:

- a storytelling game made with p5, or a Bitsy game?
- should my game be driven by text or visuals?

---

### Phone instead of snow globe

I spoke to a friend about my idea. He said maybe instead of using a snow globe, the device can be a phone. And the person can choose to erase the memories whenever they want to. He also showed me a two-minute clip of Men in Black, where the spy people flashed a flashlight thingamabob into other people's eyes and reset their memories (please excuse me if I'm getting the plot wrong, I never watched the movie).

I liked the idea of swapping the snow globe with a phone. The device's functions appear more concrete. I can create an interface with play and trim functions, as well as the ability to rewind the memory like a video. But this also poses other problems, like how do I present these memories (with limited time, I won't be able to draw out numerous scenes)? Or how do I tell a story with the interface and convey feelings of loss?

I need to rework this idea.

## Thursday, July 15, 2021, at 10:30am

I feel like my brain is a jumble of thoughts. I have this one idea that I am set on: obliterating grief through memory manipulation. For the rest, I had to sort out my thoughts with writing and sketches.

### Speculative world

This is a world where memory is selective, so maybe storefronts can feature posters that hint at the normalcy of people having the choice to select their memories?

![Propaganda: selective memory](images/july15-propaganda-selective-memory.jpg)

---

### Sketches on the game's look

Either I can create a video editing tool, where the video is the memory...
![Video editing interface](images/july15-video-editing-ui.jpg)

Or I can present a very bubbly interface, which is ironic since the theme is death.
![Bubbly and happy interface](images/july15-bubbly-ui.jpg)

I like the bubbly interface approach because (1) it fits my art style, and (2) it contrasts nicely with death.

Alrighty, with one decision out of the way, let's tackle the other 99.

---

### Choosing a technology to use

Weighing the pros and cons, no decision yet

![Tool considerations](images/july15-tool-considerations.jpg)

---

### Reflecting on how to tell the story

Methods of presenting the story:

![Methods of presenting the story](images/july15-method-story1.jpg)
![Methods of presenting the story continuation](images/july15-method-story2.jpg)

Questions to ponder on:

- Does the player know the story is about the dead?
- Does the cute look interfere with the sad storytelling?

---

### New idea! Game action

What if one of the actions is to dig deeper into the network of memories to isolate the sad ones?

Then once you capture the sad memory, you toss it into the abyss?

I have to sketch this out:

![Tool considerations](images/july15-game-idea-sketches.jpg)

What I drew:

1. Digging for sad memories, app character (orange potato character) guides you
2. Say you captured a sad memory, it plays the memory of you spending time with the loved one
3. Fades into flowers (bubbly interface of the app)
4. App character tosses sad memory (green character) off a cliff

## Friday, July 16, 2021, at 4:07pm

I had some time to solidify my thoughts.

### Game idea in one sentence

Player uses an app called "Memorywash" to delete memories of the dead and eliminate the feeling of grief

---

### More deetz on actions

1. In the app, you keep digging into your memories

2. When you touch a sad memory (personified as a character), you get sucked into it and watch it play out

3. When memory is done playing, you beat up the sad memory character in a battle --> brainwashing and elimination process

4. After defeating memory, you toss it off a cliff, the sad memory bar goes down, then you repeat the process (will probably encounter about 2-3 memories in total)

In the end: you have relinquished all memories of the dead and regret that you chose to forget

---

### Aesthetics

Very happy and cute (ironic as you don't normally associate this with death)

Sad memory: blue character

When you get sucked into the memory, it starts off looking bleak but gets more colorful (showing that you are becoming more comfortable with confronting the memory)

---

### Fight actions against sad memory

Actions centered around the idea of washing (cleaning up the memory + brainwashing):

- Sprinkle with flowers
- Shoot rainbow rays

---

### Questions remaining:

- Is scope too large considering time limit?
- What are the 2-3 sad memories that I will present?
- How do I present those memories? Image? Text? Video?

### Today's focus: Reflecting on the idea of play and storytelling approaches

I researched some game design methods by fetching out my old notes from [Prof. Enric Llagostera](https://enric.llagostera.com.br/)'s Intro to Game Design course. His lectures were filled with gems and helped to guide my design choices for this game.

Here are some of the notes I took:

---

### Playtesting

- Playtesting is important! (need to add this to my to-do list: make a playtesting schedule)

---

### Play:

- Play is **carnivalesque**. It seeks equilibrium between creation and destruction.
  - My game: character digs out/replays memories with the goal of destroying it.
- Play is **personal**, linked to our individual memories.
- Success is determined by how well the player plays the game.
  - A reminder to my game: if I create a good game, I can get the player emotionally invested in it.
- Think back to an experience I've had with a well-played game.
  - One game I really enjoyed playing is [Under a Star Called Sun](https://duckduckgo.com) by Cecile Richard. It also delves into the concept of grief, presenting it beautifully with storytelling, visuals, and music.
- Play is **disruptive** + breaks the status quo.
  - Guess this ties to the whole idea of speculative play. In my case, I'm reflecting on how manipulation of memory can be ruinous in the context of abolishing grief.

---

### Storytelling:

- Stories are connected to our **memories**.
- Stories can be told using a variety of in-game elements.
  - I want mine to use **images, setting, characters, and sound** as the main narrative elements:
    - Images: in presenting the Memorywash app interface, setting, etc. --> need to figure out how abstract I want these to be
    - Setting: the tunnel of memories (very cute), the memory setting (more emotional and relatable)
    - Characters: app mascot, main character, sad memory personified, characters within the memory
    - Sound: mix of happy and sad, piano playing
- I want to use stories **as a quest and as a choice**:
  - Player actions allow story to progress.
  - The story becomes a source of tension and experience.
- A thought I had: I can progress the story based on the kinds of memories that the player chooses to encounter.
  - This can be tied in with the action of digging into the memories. Digging is a process that leads to choice.
  - Ex of branching path: If you click A: a happy memory tugs at you, but you have to dig really deep to find it. If you click W: a really really sad force lingers nearby, drawing you in and overwhelming you.
- Branching structure: I want to go with a reconverging branching structure.
  - Why?
    - I want to conclude with 1 ending.
    - I want the player to choose between multiple memory paths along the way.
    - Less complicated than "shrub" structure, where there are too many paths.

### Reflections when designing game stories:

1. Why does this game/story matter?
2. Perspective: who is telling the story?
3. Storyboarding

## Tuesday, July 20, 2021, at 4:16pm

### A change in the idea

After sharing my game idea with Pippin, he gave me some points to reflect on.

1. The purpose of the battle mechanism: is it really essential?

Since the memory erasing tool is part of the world, the process of removing the memory should be trivial. There shouldn't be a complex battle involved.

I thought a simple "Delete" button would be way more effective.

2. A possible twist in the game direction

Instead of focusing on the notion of escaping grief, the game can explore the action of selecting memories. For instance, when the user runs out of memory, the system can be biased and encourage the user to erase memories related to the dead.

---

### What is my game?

The player manages their memory storage using an app called "MemoryWash" that proposes what is trendy and worth keeping versus what is irrelevant and should be deleted ASAP. Heads up! Memories of the dead fit in the latter category.

---

### Photoshop mockup

![Photoshop mockup](images/july20-mockup.jpg)

Memories are stored in these cards. When you click "play," it shows you the memory. You can choose to delete it or scroll through the other memories to find one to delete.

MB = memorybytes

---

### Challenge

Math. I'm not sure how to create a system that measures the amount of memorybytes used.

If say a bad memory takes up 5MB while the happy ones take up 1MB, once you remove the bad memory, does the system automatically delete the 5 happy memories?

## Wednesday, July 21, 2021, at 2:22pm

### Notes about the mascot

The mascot of the app acts like a game show host. In fact, the whole app is designed to look like a game show:

"Which memory do you choose? One will die, the other will live on."

The mascot (representative of the system) has a voice that communicates its biased feelings. Tries to push you towards keeping the "trendy, happy" memories. Berates you for keeping "negative" memories.

---

### Photoshop mockup

![Photoshop mockup](images/july21-mockup.jpg)

Instead of showing multiple memory cards in the "current memory" pile, the system puts one pending memory against one bad memory.

This one-on-one placement of memories allows me to bypass the math challenge discussed yesterday. It also reduces the amount of decision-making that the player needs to do, which is great because they can focus more on the content of the memory instead of being overwhelmed by the abundance of choices.

### Bye bye mobile-friendliness

I calculate the amount of time I have left to finish my tasks and updated the schedule at the top of the page. I initially wanted to make my game mobile-friendly but had to abandon the idea given the time limit.

### Goal setting

One thing I need to remind myself is to not get carried away with prettifying things too early. There is no harm in low fidelity, Sharon!!

After reading _The New One Minute Manager_, I am convinced that the best way to manage my time is to set clear goals.

So here goes my goals... My next goal is to complete a quick prototype of the interactions between the app and the memories.

To break this down:

- Write a memory I want to implement
- Prototype two quick memories, one in the "Pending memories" pile and one in the "Current memories" pile
- Code the "Delete" and "Keep" buttons to allow users to manage memories in "Current memories" pile

---

### Design of the memories

I want the memories to be represented using abstracted shapes and dialogs. The memories that are better stored have stronger outlines and shapes, while faded memories have foggy and vague shapes. I wonder what emotions arise when users see abstract shapes that tell a story.

---

### Terms & Conditions

Since the context of the game is that it's a memory-management app, I want to introduce the app with a series of terms and conditions. At the very bottom of the list, the fine print will disclose of some unfavorable consequences of using the app.

## Wednesday, August 3, 2021, at 9:20pm

### New name for memory sections

I had an idea. Instead of categorizing the memories under "Pending memories" and "Current memories," I can label them as "Fresh memories" and "Old memories." I think this will reduce confusion for the user in terms of what types of memories they're looking at.

---

### New button for preview videos

I originally wanted the player to only have the option of managing the old memories. Therefore, there was a "Delete" and "Keep" button for the old memory section, and the user was unable to change the pending Memory until they delete an old memory.

These buttons needed change. What I really needed was to allow the user to choose between an old memory and a fresh memory. The solution was to replace the "Delete" and "Keep" buttons to "Choose Me!" buttons that fall under both the Old Memory and Fresh Memory sections. Once the user clicks on "Choose Me!", the system will randomly select another old and fresh memory for the user to choose. Also, the app mascot will respond depending on the choices that the user makes. For instance, if the user keeps choosing old memories over the fresh ones, then the mascot will be disappointed. On the other hand, if the user opts for the fresher memories, the mascot will be happier. This reaction reveals the system's biased nature.

---

### Update on dialog boxes

Here's how they're looking so far:
![Coding process: Dialog box](images/august3-dialog-box.jpg)

## Saturday, August 14, 2021, at 2:50pm

### Update

Coding the memories was tricky because I wasn't sure how to make the dialog flow in relation to the player's interactions with the characters. I wanted the dialogs to drive the actions (e.g. in a soccer match, the character says something then I program the character to kick the ball, giving the player the option to kick the ball once in a while). But now I think that the easier method is to have the player actions drive the dialogs. For instance, when the player has the ability to kick the ball during the whole memory, and once the player kicks the ball a certain number of times, it cues the next dialog. With action-driven dialogs, I can integrate branching narratives more easily as well.

Another challenge is that, having chosen p5.js as my tool, a lot of actions take time to be coded from scratch. While I get a lot of practice coding, I am slowly realizing that there may be some drawbacks with the amount of time spent on coding all the interactions.

## Sunday, August 29, 2021, at 2:03pm

### Lessons learned

We have nearly reached the end. I am now 58 hours and 50 minutes into the game development and still have a lot to do, but I wanted to pause for a moment to reflect on all the things I learned.

I'm sitting in front of my window now and looking at the rain fall peacefully onto the ground. I guess it reflects how I'm feeling right now, a strange sense of calm. My biggest take-away is managing tasks and learning how much time it takes for me to code. At the start, I had a hard time deciding on the game and this is where most of the time leaked away. Towards the middle of the 60 hours, I started really pinpointing what tasks were most crucial and putting a time limit to them, though I quickly realized that it's hard to set a time when I can't take into account the bugs that might spontaneously appear. As I kept coding away, I started setting more accurate time estimations for tasks. So even with all the foibles at the beginning, I'm not discouraged. I am happy with the idea that there is still a long way to go with improving my time management when coding. I am excited to find other tools to stay focused.

One thing I did which was different from my previous coding projects is that I kept most of the asset-making for the end, so that I can focus on programming. Also, I've wondered since the start if I would regret choosing p5. Despite the amount of time it took to code interactions from scratch using p5, I don't regret choosing it because it helped me practice a lot. I explored many tactics for keeping my code organized.

---

### Dialog update

Major change! I switched the text-based dialog to audio dialogs inside the memories. For text-based dialogs, I wasn't sure how to integrate it with the interactive actions. Meanwhile, the advantages of audio-based dialogs is that it has methods for cueing, it does not compete with the actions (in fact, the actions drive the dialogs), and it gives the characters another dimension. I recorded my little cousins' voices for the characters. It was a fun change of pace from clicking and clacking on my keyboard.

## Monday, August 30, 2021, at 9:12am

### Milestone

Alright folks, I have reached the end of the 60 hours! Wahoooooo!

I am proud of what I've designed so far and want to acknowledge my hard work.

With that said, there are still some modifications I am planning to do before my teammates playtest it. I want to at least give them a playable prototype so that the game makes sense.

So my final to-dos before August 31 midnight are as follows:

1. Add Daddy's audio dialogs (voiced by Bryan Ku)
2. Finish the intro, including Captain Nibbu's speech to explain what the game is all about
3. Complete MemoryMakingBao drawings
4. Polish MemoryMakingBao
5. Complete MemoryInstaPic drawings
6. Polish MemoryInstaPic

And maybeeeeeee if I want to do more, I can also:

7. Add audio dialogs to MemorySoccer
8. Complete MemorySoccer drawings
9. Polish MemorySoccer
10. Make end scene drawings
11. Program the end scene

---

### Worry about death

My only concern is that I was not able to implement the theme of death yet. I wanted the theme to come towards the end of the game. And since the game is all cutesy in an ironic way, it ESPECIALLY deters from the theme. Oh well, c'est la vie.

## Friday, September 3, 2021, at 9:15pm

### Letting go of incoming memories

Ok ok, alright, yes, okay, ANOTHER MAJOR UPDATE.

I decided to let go of the incoming memories categories.

Initially, I intended for the incoming memories to serve these two purposes:

1. Allow the player to have more choices (either select old or incoming memory to keep)
2. Provide context as to how Lu is doing now, compared to her past (in other words, show how the memories of the dead has affected how she is living today)

But the drawbacks of having incoming memories is that it:

1. Causes confusion as to why it exists --> more choices makes it harder for the player to follow what is going on
2. Is hard to weave a convincing and concise narrative by introducing additional, somewhat unnecessary plots in relation to the old memories
3. Reduces the impact of the old memories
4. Requires additional coding time, time that can be better allocated to polishing the old memories and app interface

I want to place the spotlight on the old memories, and since the incoming memories are undermining them, I think it is time for me to let them go.
